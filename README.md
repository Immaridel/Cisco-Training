# Summary
This repo contains notes that were taken during training courses hosted by Cisco for the Network Services Orchestrator product.  Below I will give a brief overview of how to use the notes for each class, since they were taken at differnt times and therefore are structured inconsistently based on my mood and coffee ingestion rate.

## NSO Admin & DevOps
Each folder corresponds to a different lab from the class.  Contained in the folder is a PDF of the lab from the class, giving the instructions to follow, and a file called 'lab.md', which contains my personal command input and output from performing the lab tasks.

I made notes where I found need to do so, but for the most part it will likely look much like the example output from the PDF.

## NSO Advanced Programming for Python
Each folder corresponds to a lab (or two, in one case) in which I have provided the files that the PDF instructions had me edit.

Aside from the PDF of lab instructions and the presence of the edited Python, YANG, and XML files, there's not a lot of consistency here.  Read the lab and use the edited files for reference.

## NSO Essentials for Programmers 4.2
This was the first class I attended, so these "notes" are pretty sloppy.  The main folder contains Python, YANG, and XML files that are named to correspond to the lab that was being worked on.  

This is ugly, but, it's here for reference.
